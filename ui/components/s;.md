The fact that your debug log is repeating 30-40 times suggests there's a **rendering loop** or **state update loop** happening, which might be causing the buttons to stay unclickable due to constant re-renders.

## The Loop Issue:

The repeated logs indicate that `AiTurnBlock` is constantly re-rendering, which could be:

1. **State atom updates** in a loop
2. **Messages atom** constantly changing
3. **Eligibility recalculating** repeatedly

## Quick Debug - Find the Loop Source:

Add this to identify what's causing the re-renders:

```typescript
// In AiTurnBlock.tsx - at the top of the component
console.log(`[AiTurnBlock Render] ${aiTurn.id}`, {
  renderCount: useRef(0).current++, // Count renders
  synthesisResponsesChanged: aiTurn.synthesisResponses !== prevSynthesisRef.current,
  messagesLength: messages?.length // If you have messages in scope
});

// Or use useEffect to track prop changes
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`[AiTurnBlock Props Changed] ${aiTurn.id}`, {
    synthesisResponses: aiTurn.synthesisResponses,
    batchResponses: aiTurn.batchResponses
  });
}, [aiTurn.synthesisResponses, aiTurn.batchResponses]);
```

## Immediate Things to Check:

### 1. **Is `useEligibility` causing infinite updates?**
```typescript
// In useEligibility.ts - check if this is recalculating constantly
const eligibilityMaps = useMemo(() => {
  // This should only run when messages change
  console.log('[useEligibility] Recalculating all maps');
  // ... calculation
}, [messages, buildEligibilityForRound]); // Make sure dependencies are correct
```

### 2. **Check for State Update in Render:**
Look for any `setState` calls or atom setters that might be called during render in:
- `AiTurnBlock.tsx`
- `AiTurnBlockConnected.tsx` 
- `useEligibility.ts`

### 3. **Temporary Fix - Isolate the Issue:**
Temporarily bypass all the logic to see if it's a data issue vs rendering issue:

```typescript
// In ClipsCarousel.tsx - temporary override
const isDisabled = false; // Force enable all buttons

// Or in AiTurnBlockConnected.tsx
const handleClipClick = (type: 'synthesis' | 'mapping', providerId: string) => {
  console.log('Clip clicked - would run synthesis');
  // Actually call the real handler to test
  realHandleClipClick(aiTurn.id, type, providerId);
};
```

## The Root Cause Might Be:

The rendering loop is probably **preventing click events from being processed** or **constantly resetting button states** to disabled.

**Add the render counter first** to confirm it's a loop, then we can trace what's causing the constant updates. The fact that you fixed the `hasExisting` logic but it's still broken + the loop suggests there's a broader state management issue.
